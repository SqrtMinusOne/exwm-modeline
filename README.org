#+TITLE: exwm-modeline

A modeline segment to display exwm workspaces.

Here's how it looks near the list of [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspectives]] (the segment of the current package is to the left):
[[./img/screenshot.png]]
- workspaces 0 and 5 do not have any X windows
- workspace 1 is the current workspace
- workspace 2 has at least one X window.

Features:
- Supports =exwm-randr= to display only workspaces related to the current monitor.
- Numbers are clickable.

* Installation
As the package isn't yet available anywhere but in this repository, you can clone the repository, add it to the =load-path=, and =require= the package:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'exwm-modeline)
#+end_src

My preferred way is to use =use-package= with =straight=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package exwm-modeline
  :straight (:host github :repo "SqrtMinusOne/exwm-modeline")
  :after (exwm))
#+end_src

Then put a call to =exwm-modeline-mode= somewhere after the moment when EXWM has been initialized, for instance:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'exwm-init-hook #'exwm-modeline-mode)
#+end_src

* Customization
Set =exwm-modeline-randr= to nil to turn off filtering of workspaces by monitor.

Set =exwm-modeline-short= to =t= display only the current workspace in the modeline.

Set =exwm-modeline-display-urgent= to nil to turn off displaying whether a workspace has an urgent window. This will significantly decrease the number of modeline updates, which may help with performance issues.

* Credits
[[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective.el]] by [[https://github.com/nex3][@nex3]] was extremely instructive on how to make a modeline segment individual to a particular frame and avoid recalculating it too often.

[[https://github.com/elken/doom-modeline-exwm][doom-modeline-exwm]] by [[https://github.com/elken][@elken]] also was a source of inspiration.
